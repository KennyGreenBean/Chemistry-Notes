## Example Problem
Find the Empirical Formula of a compound that is 26.6% Potassium, 35.4% Chromium, and 38.0% Oxygen

Molar masses:
$$
m_{K} = 39 \frac{g}{mol}
$$
$$
m_{Cr} = 52 \frac{g}{mol}
$$
$$
m_{O} = 16 \frac{g}{mol}
$$
We can use the percent composition of the compound as the total mass of each element to find the number of [[Moles]], which also gives us the mole ratio of the elements in the compound. 

$$
n_{K} = \frac{26.6}{39} = 0.682
$$
$$
n_{Cr} = \frac{35.4}{52} = 0.681
$$
$$
n_{O} = \frac{38}{16} = 2.38
$$
Divide each number by the smallest value to make process easier. 

$$
n_{k} = \frac{0.682}{0.681} = 1
$$
$$
n_{Cr} = \frac{0.681}{0.681} = 1
$$
$$
n_{O} = \frac{2.38}{0.681} = 3.5
$$
Multiply all numbers by the same value to make all numbers whole numbers. 
$$
n_{k} = 1*2 = 2
$$
$$
n_{Cr} = 1*2 = 2
$$
$$
n_{O} = 3.5*2 = 7
$$
Therefore, the empirical formula is **$$K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$$**
