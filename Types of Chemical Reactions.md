# Synthesis
When two reactions interact to form one product
$$
A + B \to AB
$$
# Decomposition
When the reactant breaks down into simpler products
$$
AB \to A + B
$$
# Single Displacement
When an element replaces another element in a compound
**A metal only replaces a metal, and a nonmetal only replaces a nonmetal**
**Only a more reactive element can replace the other element in the compound with which it reacts**

Refer to [[Reactivity Series]] for more info on reactivity.
$$
A + BC \to C + AB
$$
# Double Displacement
When the positive and negative ions of two [[Ionic Compounds]] exchange places to form two new compounds
$$
AB + CD \to AD + BC
$$
**Double displacement reactions do not occur when both products are aqueous ([[States]])**

## Types of Double Displacement Reactions

### Precipitation Reaction
When an insoluble (solid) ionic compound forms ([[Solubility Rules]])

### Gas Formation
When a gas is produced as a product of the reaction

### Neutralization Reaction
When an acid ([[Acids and Bases]]) meets a base to produce salt and water
# Combustion
Happens rapidly and violently with oxygen
Anything burning is a combustion reaction

Typical Reactants are **Metals** or **Hydrocarbons**

## Combustion Reactions with Metals
When reacting with **Metal**, an ionic compound forms between the metal and oxygen. 
Eg. $2Mg + O_{2} \to 2MgO$
## Combustion Reactions with Hydrocarbons

### Complete Combustion
Occurs when there is enough oxygen to completely react with all of the hydrocarbon
$$
CH_{4} + 2O_{2} \to CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O
$$
### Incomplete Combustion
When there is not enough oxygen to completely react with all of the hydrocarbon. Then, **soot** is formed, which can typically be carbon monoxide or just carbon. 
$$
3CH_{4} + 5O_{2} \to CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + 2CO
$$
$$
2CH_{4} + 3O_{2} \to CO_{2} + 4H_{2}O + C
$$
