The relationship between the weights of reactants and the products before, during, and after the reaction. 

# Steps
## Step 1:
Write balanced chemical equation

## Step 2:
Calculate number of [[Moles]] of reactant

## Step 3:
Determine [[Limiting Reagent]] to find number of complete reactions that can occur

## Step 4:
Use ratios of balanced equation to find the moles of reactants and products

## Step 5:
Use molar mass of product and moles to find the weight of the products


## Example Problem

What mass of oxygen will be produced by heating 400.g of potassium chlorate?

### Balanced Equation:
$$
2KClO_{3} \to 2KCl + 3O_{2}
$$

Molar mass of potassium chlorate  = 122.55Â g/mol

[[Moles]] of Potassium Chlorate = $\frac{400.0g}{122.55g}$ = 3.264 mol

Limiting reagent is Potassium Chlorate (Only reactant)

For every 2 moles of potassium chlorate, 3 moles oxygen is produced 
(Determined from [[Molar Ratio]])

[[Moles]] of Oxygen = $3.254mol * \frac{3}{2} = 4.896mol$

Molar Mass of Oxygen = $16 * 2 = 32g$
*Multiplied by 2 because oxygen is diatomic, as seen in the balanced chemical equation*

Mass of Oxygen produced = Moles * Molar Mass = $4.896 * 16 * 2 = 156.672g \to 157g$

Therefore, mass of oxygen produced is **157g**
