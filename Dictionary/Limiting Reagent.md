The reactant that runs out the quickest in the reaction, which results in an imcomplete reaction. 

## Example:
How much $ZnCl_{2}$ can be produced from a reaction with 2 mol of Zn and 3 mol of HCl

### Balanced Equation

$$
Zn + 2HCl \to ZnCl_{2} + H_{2}
$$
2x more hydrochloric acid than Zinc is required for the reaction to occur. From this we can use the amount of each compound we have to determine which one is the limiting reagent. 

Zinc allows reaction to happen $\frac{2mol}{1} = 2$ times
Hydrochloric acid allows reaction to happen $\frac{3mol}{2} = 1.5$ times

Therefore, There is not enough hydrochloric acid to fully react with all the zinc
