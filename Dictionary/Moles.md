# Definition
A base unit for the amount of a substance, that is proportional to the number of particles of a substance. 

# Units
Moles (Mol)

$1 Mol = 6.022 * 10^{23}$ particles = 22.4 Liters


# Calculating moles
## Solids and liquids

$$
Mol = \frac{m}{M}
$$

$m$ - mass of the current amount of compound
M - Molar mass of compound

## Gases
Derivation of Ideal Gas Law
$$
n = \frac{PV}{RT}
$$
$P$ - [[Pressure]]
$V$ - [[Volume]]
$R$ - [[Gas Constant]]
$T$ - [[Temperature]]
