Each particle in gases carry kinetic energy, and this energy of each particle is directly related to temperature

$P$ - [[Pressure]]
$V$ - [[Volume]]
$T$ - [[Temperature]] (Always in Kelvin)
$n$ - [[Moles]]
$R$ - [[Gas Constant]]

Variables change depending on surroundings. These surroundings will either be specifically stated or can be at [[STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure)]] or [[SATP (Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure)]].
# Combined Gas Law
$$
\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{T_{1}} = \frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{T_{2}}
$$
# Ideal Gas Law
$$
PV = nRT
